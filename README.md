Setting up things

If you're on Heroku just add these in the Environmental Variables
or if you're Locally hosting, create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add all the variables there.
An example of `.env` file:

```py
DATABASE_URL=  Get this from mongodb.com
PORT=8080
API_ID= Get from my.telegram.org
NO_PORT=False
BOT_TOKEN= Get from botfather
OWNER_ID= your owner id 
API_HASH= Get from my.telegram.org
UPDATES_CHANNEL= Enter Force sub channel username without @ if any  else set value to None
BIN_CHANNEL=-100
SESSION_NAME=TEAM_VAMPIR
HAS_SSL=True
FQDN= Enter Custom domain if any or server ip
```
